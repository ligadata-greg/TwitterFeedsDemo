There are three things to know about models and how they are organized:

1) Models in the attic are old, possibly out of date, and may not build.  They however are rich in examples of what you might do in one of your own models.

2) Models in dev are models in active development.  Like the attic models, they may not build or execute.  Once they do build and execute (there is test data available to exercise them), they will be moved into this directory.

3) Models in the directory where this README resides purportedly work.  They can be added to the Metadata through the MetadataAPI and have the necessary test data to exercise them in the FatafatManager.
